# Trying to make an Image Recognition neural network

This project never got off the ground. Backpropagation is extremely difficult, and I haven't studied enough of the computer science to understand how to build something complex enough to process these images.
I also had a plan to make this a generative network, and that is obviously much harder, so I also did not complete that.
